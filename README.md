# Explaining Spring

## Controller
- The **@Controller** is the "front desk" of your application, managing communication between the user and the rest of the system.
- The **controller** is the person taking orders from customers.

---
The **@Controller** annotation in Spring is like the person at the lemonade stand who takes orders from customers. Here's how it works:

The **@Controller** class is responsible for handling requests from users (like customers placing orders).
It listens for specific instructions (HTTP requests) and decides what to do next.
It passes the work to the @Service class (the one that "makes the lemonade") and then gives the result back to the user (like handing over the lemonade).

---

## Service
- The **@Service** class is the one that knows how to "make the lemonade" (do the main work or business logic). It takes instructions from the controller and uses the repository to get what it needs to finish the job.
- The **service** is the person making the lemonade (mixing water, sugar, and lemons).

The **@Service** is the person making the lemonade (mixing water, sugar, and lemons).

The **@Service** annotation in Spring is like the person behind the counter who actually prepares the lemonade when someone places an order.

The **@Service** class receives the request from the @Controller, understands what needs to be done, and handles the logic.

## Repository
- The **@Repository** is the part of your application that manages the data, ensuring everything is stored and retrieved properly.
- The **repository** is where the lemons, sugar, and water are stored.

---
The **@Repository** annotation in Spring is like the storage room at the lemonade stand where all the ingredients (lemons, sugar, and water) are kept. Here's how it works:


The **@Repository** class is responsible for interacting with the database (or storage) to get or save data.
It provides the service with the ingredients it needs to do its job (like giving lemons, sugar, and water to the person making lemonade).
It also stores any leftover or new data back into the database (like putting unused lemons back in storage).
